## §Registry link

> Read-only snapshot — authority is [`foundation-disposition.registry.ts`](../../../packages/architecture-authority/src/data/foundation-disposition.registry.ts). Registry `domain` is `operating-context`; this FDR scopes the **api-governance** subdomain on the same `PKG007_CONTEXT` entry. Acceptance gates `pnpm check:api-contracts` and `pnpm check:api-route-catalog` are listed in registry `gates[]` (synced 2026-06-26).

## Package ownership

| Package | Role | runtimeOwner path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@afenda/erp` (PKG-007) | API contract registry, envelope runtime, route coverage validation | `apps/erp/src/server/api/` |
| `@afenda/permissions` (PKG-014) | Permission keys on protected contracts (read-only consumer) | `packages/permissions/src/grants/` |
| `@afenda/kernel` (PKG-010) | Branded execution context in envelopes (read-only consumer) | `packages/kernel/src/context/` |
| Governance scripts | Repo-level contract drift gate | `scripts/api-contract/` |

## Purpose

Lock and maintain REST-first, envelope-based API contract governance for all governed ERP routes — serializable `ApiRouteContract` registry, method/idempotency/pagination policy, `createApiHandler` boundary enforcement, operating-context resolution, RBAC, and stable success/error envelopes — so every non-auth ERP route is registered, test-evidenced, and CI-gated before Accounting Core activation.

Authority: [ADR-0014](../../adr/ADR-0014-foundation-disposition-registry.md) · [ADR-0016](../../adr/ADR-0016-fdr-delivery-authority.md).

Archive input (not implementation authority): [`tip-010a-api-contract-governance.md`](../../delivery/tips/[Complete]%20tip-010a-api-contract-governance.md).

## Scope

**In scope**

- `apps/erp/src/server/api/contracts/` — envelope, method policy, idempotency, pagination, error taxonomy, route coverage, contract registry
- `apps/erp/src/server/api/runtime/` — `createApiHandler`, validation, response envelope, correlation, audit hooks, idempotency runtime (in-memory)
- `apps/erp/src/server/api/__tests__/` — registry, envelope, handler boundary tests
- `scripts/api-contract/check-api-contracts.mts` — route coverage + policy drift gate
- `scripts/api-contract/governed-api-routes.mts` — CI evidence re-export
- FDR evidence reconciliation against archive tip-010a + runtime matrix **partial** row

**Out of scope**

- Public OpenAPI catalog (future product TIP)
- Accounting domain API routes (ADR-0010)
- Durable idempotency store — Postgres `api_idempotency_records` (migration `20260626110401_polite_lucky_pierre`)
- Real rate-limit provider — Postgres `api_rate_limit_buckets`; wired in `createApiHandler`
- Operating-context resolver pipeline internals (`fdr-007-operating-context`)
- System Admin page delivery (`fdr-007-system-admin` — admin contracts are consumers of this FDR)

## §Subagent concurrency rules

| Rule | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Registry ownership | Only `foundation-registry-owner` may edit `foundation-disposition.registry.ts` |
| Package boundary | Implementation agent may edit only `apps/erp/src/server/api/` and `scripts/api-contract/` paths under §Scope |
| Shared constants | No agent may duplicate contract IDs or envelope shapes outside `api-contract-registry.ts` and contract modules |
| Evidence output | Agents must output file paths + gate exit 0 — not prose-only claims |
| Parallel PKG-007 | **Sequential** with `fdr-007-operating-context`, `fdr-007-system-admin`, `fdr-007-ux-surfaces` — same `runtimeOwner`; orchestrator serializes shared `apps/erp` edits |
| Handoff authority | Executable 9-field handoff blocks authored only by `fdr-slice-author` — not in this FDR |

## §Research

> Slice 1 **Complete** (2026-06-25). Research reconciled archive tip-010a, runtime matrix API row, and live gate exit codes with FDR delivery evidence grades.

### Discovery questions — answers (Slice 1)

| Question | Answer | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Does `pnpm check:api-contracts` exit 0? | **Yes** | Gate log below — "API contract drift check passed" |
| Are all non-auth ERP routes registered in `API_CONTRACTS`? | **Yes** — 10 contracts; coverage validator passes | `api-contract-registry.ts`; `check-api-contracts.mts` |
| Do governed routes use `createApiHandler` (no raw `Response.json`)? | **Yes** — route boundary scan passes | `api-route-coverage.ts`; `api-handler-boundary.test.ts` |
| Are method + idempotency policies enforced on every contract? | **Yes** | `method-policy.contract.ts`; `idempotency.contract.ts`; gate policy loop |
| Is durable idempotency store implemented? | **Yes** — Postgres-backed replay store | `packages/database/src/api-governance/` · `runtime/idempotency-postgres.ts` |
| Is rate-limit enforcement active? | **Yes** — contract policy enforced in handler | `runtime/api-rate-limit.ts` · `api-rate-limit.test.ts` |
| Does runtime matrix **partial** align with FDR promotion? | **No — reconciled** — matrix row **implemented** (2026-06-25 v2 audit); gate passes | §Remaining gaps `api-matrix-row-sync` closed |

## §Remaining gaps

> Gap tracking lives here — registry `knownGaps` is deprecated.

| Gap ID | Description | Lane impact | Owner | Target slice | Close condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `api-idempotency-store` | ~~Durable idempotency store~~ **Closed 2026-06-26** | green | `erp-app-agent` | Slice 6 | Postgres migration + ERP adapter |
| `api-registry-gate-sync` | ~~`check:api-contracts` not in registry~~ **Closed 2026-06-26** | green | `foundation-registry-owner` | Registry-sync | Added `check:api-contracts` + `check:api-route-catalog` to `PKG007_CONTEXT` gates |
| `api-matrix-row-sync` | ~~Runtime matrix row still **partial** while gate passes~~ **Closed** (v2 audit 2026-06-25) | green | Architecture Authority | — | Matrix row **implemented** |
| `api-complete-status` | FDR at 27/30 audit-adjusted; Complete blocked on peer review | green | Architecture Authority (PR) | Complete | DoD #14 peer review `[x]`; §Waivers reconfirmed |

## §Enterprise readiness score

> **Enterprise 9.5 (final)** = 29/30 on this table **and** DoD #14 peer review closed **and** waivers reconfirmed at PR ([ENTERPRISE-BENCHMARK.md §3](../../../.cursor/skills/write-fdr/ENTERPRISE-BENCHMARK.md)). Until then this FDR is an **enterprise 9.5 candidate / evidence-qualified**, not final Complete.
>
> Score 0–5 per dimension (integers only). Every point maps to gate exit 0, test path, or explicit §Waivers row.

| Dimension | Score | Evidence | Audit note |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Contract stability | 5/5 | `typecheck` exit 0 + `api-contract-registry.test.ts` (11 tests) + `check:api-contracts` exit 0 — Grade A | — |
| Test coverage | 4/5 | 19 API unit tests + route coverage gate — Grade A | Waiver `api-e2e` for browser E2E |
| Observability + audit | 4/5 | `api-handler-audit.ts` + `api-handler-logging.ts` — Grade B | Waiver `api-observability-live-traces` |
| Security + RBAC + RLS | 5/5 | Every protected contract declares permission keys; operating context via handler — Grade A | — |
| Documentation + BRD traceability | 4/5 | FDR v2 + matrix **implemented** row + drift exit 0 — Grade A | DoD #14 peer review still `[ ]` |
| Maintainability + Clean Core | 5/5 | `check:api-contracts` exit 0; single registry authority; Clean Core B — Grade A | — |
| **Total (audit-adjusted)** | **27/30** | **~9.0 / 10 equivalent** — honest green-lane score today | |
| **Total (evidence-qualified ceiling)** | **29/30** | Upper bound if §Waivers accepted and peer review pending only | Not final 9.5 until Complete |

## §Clean Core classification

| Level | Meaning | Allowed for red-lane / gate-critical? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | Registry-driven, public contracts, no local authority, no private imports | Yes |
| B | Approved extension boundary, dependency registered, no duplicated constants | Yes |
| C | Tactical workaround, bounded and tracked | No, unless ADR waiver |
| D | Local hack, duplicate constants, private import, undocumented runtime behaviour | No |

**This FDR: Level B** — contract registry at approved `apps/erp/src/server/api/contracts/` boundary; permission keys from `@afenda/permissions`; operating context from resolver pipeline (`fdr-007-operating-context`).

**Rule: red-lane or gate-critical FDRs must be Clean Core A or B.**

## §Impact analysis

| Consumer package | Import surface | Breaking change? | Clean Core impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `apps/erp` (route handlers) | `createApiHandler`, `getApiContractById`, contract exports | No | B→B |
| `fdr-007-system-admin` | `system-admin.contract.ts` API mutations | No | B→B |
| Phase 9 gate req #5 | `check:api-contracts` delegated gate | No | B→B |
| Future `@afenda/accounting` | Blocked until ADR-0010 amended — no accounting API routes | N/A | — |

Upstream consumers scan: every file under `apps/erp/src/app/api/` (non-allowlisted) must import `createApiHandler` and register a contract in `API_CONTRACTS`. Adding a route without registry entry fails `pnpm check:api-contracts`.

## §Enterprise acceptance

## Acceptance criteria

```gherkin
Feature: Governed ERP API contract registry

  Scenario: Every non-auth ERP route is registered and uses createApiHandler
    GIVEN the set of route files under apps/erp/src/app/api/
    AND allowlisted auth routes are excluded
    WHEN check-api-contracts.mts scans route sources
    THEN every governed route imports createApiHandler
    AND no governed route calls Response.json directly
    AND every governed route contract appears in API_CONTRACTS

  Scenario: Mutation contracts enforce idempotency policy
    GIVEN a registered ApiRouteContract with a mutation method
    WHEN assertIdempotencyPolicy evaluates the contract
    THEN the contract declares idempotency requirements per idempotency.contract.ts
    OR the gate reports a named policy violation

  Scenario: API success responses use the stable envelope
    GIVEN createApiHandler completes a successful request
    WHEN the handler serializes the response
    THEN the body matches api-envelope.contract.ts ok shape
    AND meta includes correlationId when observability context is present

  Scenario: Protected routes declare permission keys
    GIVEN a contract in API_CONTRACTS that requires authorization
    WHEN api-contract-registry.test.ts validates registry invariants
    THEN each such contract references keys from @afenda/permissions vocabulary

## Slices

### Slice 1 — Research (api-governance)

**Status:** Complete (2026-06-25)  
**Prerequisite:** —  
**Type:** Research  
**Risk class:** Medium  
**Clean Core impact:** B→B

**Purpose:** Reconcile archive tip-010a + runtime matrix **partial** with live `check:api-contracts` gate; map contracts → runtime → CI; update §Runtime evidence, §Remaining gaps, and §Enterprise readiness score. No source edits.

**Outcomes:**

- Baseline gate log recorded (all gates exit 0)
- Status promoted to **Partially Implemented**
- Readiness score: **27/30 audit-adjusted** (29/30 ceiling)
- Slice 2 unblocked for contract registry hardening (v2 audit matrix row reconciled in §Research)

### Slice 2 — Implementation (contract registry hardening)

**Status:** Not started  
**Prerequisite:** Slice 1 Complete ✓  
**Type:** Implementation  
**Risk class:** Medium  
**Clean Core impact:** B→B

#### Design (internal-guide)

Harden governed API contract registry against route drift — extend static coverage guards so any new `apps/erp/src/app/api/**/route.ts` must register in `API_CONTRACTS` and use `createApiHandler` before merge. Matrix row **implemented** status was reconciled in Research v2 audit; this slice closes remaining **runtime** contract-evidence gaps only.

Bounded paths:

1. **Route coverage invariants** — extend `api-route-coverage.ts` and `api-contract-registry.test.ts` with explicit contract-count and handler-export parity checks aligned to current eight registered contracts.
2. **Policy regression guards** — add negative-path assertions in `api-handler-boundary.test.ts` for direct `Response.json` bypass and missing idempotency policy on mutation contracts.
3. **Drift gate alignment** — ensure `check-api-contracts.mts` error messages name failing route file + missing registry entry (no gate logic duplication elsewhere).

Durable idempotency store (`api-idempotency-store`) and registry gate registration (`api-registry-gate-sync`) remain out of scope — deferred Slice 4 Registry-sync + waiver.

#### Handoff block

```
Handoff from: docs/delivery/FDR/[Partially Implemented] fdr-007-api-governance.md

1. Objective    — Harden API contract registry and route coverage static guards so governed ERP routes cannot merge without createApiHandler wiring and API_CONTRACTS registration; keep check:api-contracts green.

#### DoD rows this slice closes

| # | Criterion | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Tests pass | `pnpm --filter @afenda/erp test:run -- api-contract api-envelope api-handler-boundary` |
| 17 | Security negative path tested | `api-handler-boundary.test.ts` |
| 16 | No duplicated constants / parallel authority | `pnpm check:api-contracts` |

#### Known debt

- `api-idempotency-store` — durable store deferred until Accounting Core ADR amendment (waiver `api-idempotency-store`)
- `api-registry-gate-sync` — **Closed 2026-06-26** (`PKG007_CONTEXT` gates include `check:api-contracts` + `check:api-route-catalog`)
- `api-complete-status` — DoD #14 peer review blocks **Complete** promotion
- Gap `api-matrix-row-sync` closed in Research v2 audit — matrix evidence not re-edited unless status changes

### Slice 3 — Implementation (contract closeout)

**Status:** Not started  
**Prerequisite:** Slice 2 Complete ✓  
**Type:** Implementation  
**Risk class:** Medium  
**Clean Core impact:** B→B

**Purpose:** Close any remaining route coverage gaps; extend registry for new ERP API surfaces; keep `check:api-contracts` green.

**Expected deliverables:** Modified contract registry + route coverage tests if new routes land.

### Slice 4 — Registry-sync (gate registration)

**Status:** Not started  
**Prerequisite:** Slice 3 or waiver  
**Type:** Registry-sync  
**Risk class:** Low  

**Purpose:** Add `pnpm check:api-contracts` to foundation disposition registry gates via `foundation-registry-owner`.

## §Rollback strategy

| Slice | Rollback procedure | Upgrade path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Research | Revert FDR doc commit | Safe — no runtime change |
| Implementation | Revert `apps/erp/src/server/api/` commit; re-run `pnpm check:api-contracts` | Quarterly-release-safe; git revert + gate re-run |
| Registry-sync | Revert registry commit via `foundation-registry-owner` | Re-run `pnpm check:foundation-disposition` |

Oracle analog: confirm upgrade-safe — no handler bypass outside `createApiHandler`. SAP analog: transport rollback = git revert + `pnpm check:api-contracts`.

## §Waivers

| Waiver ID | Requirement waived | Reason | Approver | Expiry / revisit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `api-idempotency-store` | ~~Durable idempotency persistence~~ **Closed** | Postgres store delivered slice 6 | Architecture Authority | — |
| `api-e2e` | Browser E2E for API routes | Unit + drift gate prove registry; matrix marks E2E optional | Architecture Authority | External beta go-live |
| `api-observability-live-traces` | Live distributed trace on every API call (ISO observability 5/5) | Correlation ID + handler logging present; full trace deferred | Architecture Authority | `fdr-013-logging-tracing` |

## §Knowledge transfer

### Operational runbook

- Contract registry: `apps/erp/src/server/api/contracts/api-contract-registry.ts` — add contract + export in `GOVERNED_ROUTE_CONTRACT_EXPORTS`
- Route handler pattern: `apps/erp/src/server/api/runtime/create-api-handler.ts`
- Drift gate: `pnpm check:api-contracts` — run before any new `apps/erp/src/app/api/**/route.ts`
- Policy modules: `method-policy.contract.ts`, `idempotency.contract.ts`, `pagination.contract.ts`

### Observability

- Handler audit: `apps/erp/src/server/api/runtime/api-handler-audit.ts`
- Correlation: `apps/erp/src/server/api/runtime/api-correlation.ts`
- Client error contract: `apps/erp/src/server/api/contracts/observability/client-error.contract.ts`

### On-call escalation

- Symptom: CI `check:api-contracts` fails on new route → register contract + use `createApiHandler`
- Symptom: idempotency replay miss → expected until durable store; check in-memory map scope
- Owner: `@afenda/erp` (PKG-007) via `erp-app-agent`

## §Enterprise benchmark qualification

This FDR is **enterprise 9.5 candidate / evidence-qualified**, not final **Complete — enterprise 9.5 accepted**, because DoD #14 peer review remains open.

The **29/30 evidence-qualified ceiling** is accepted only under these bounded assumptions:

1. Internal OpenAPI catalog delivered ([`ARCH-API-002`](../ARCH/ARCH-API-002-openapi-internal-v1-catalog.md)); Kong and public v1 remain P2.
2. Browser E2E is waived until external beta go-live (`api-e2e`).
3. Live distributed trace on every API call is deferred (`api-observability-live-traces`).
4. **Complete** status requires Architecture Authority peer review and waiver reconfirmation at PR merge.

The **27/30 audit-adjusted** score is the honest green-lane benchmark today (~9.0 / 10 equivalent): registry, envelope, and route coverage proven by CI; capped by waived E2E, observability deferral, and open peer review.

**Promotion to Complete — enterprise 9.5 accepted requires:**

1. Architecture Authority peer review approval (DoD #14).
2. Confirmation that §Waivers remain valid at merge time.
3. FDR filename/status/index promotion to `[Complete]`.

## Verdict

**Partially Implemented — enterprise 9.5 candidate / evidence-qualified at 27/30 audit-adjusted (29/30 ceiling), pending Architecture Authority peer review.**

v3 audit refresh (2026-06-26): ten registered contracts; Postgres idempotency + rate limits; ARCH-API-001 Complete (DoD #14); ARCH-API-002 OpenAPI internal v1 catalog; 49+ API unit tests exit 0. Kong/public v1 remain P2.
