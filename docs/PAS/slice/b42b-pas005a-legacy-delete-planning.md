# Slice B42b — Appshell Legacy Parity Inventory & Delete Planning (PAS-005A §11.1 · §11.4)

> **Superseded (2026-06-28):** Delete preconditions and planning inventory remain historical evidence. **Filesystem delete executed in B42h** — legacy `shadcn-studio/` path removed; governed blocks relocated to `packages/appshell/src/presentation/`. See [`b42h-pas005a-legacy-tree-delete.md`](b42h-pas005a-legacy-tree-delete.md).

**Prerequisite:** B42 delivered (partial) — ERP CSS chain, metadata-ui theme hook, ADR-0017 retarget, `PKGR05A_SHADCN_STUDIO` promoted (`amber-lane`)

**Status:** Planning delivered (2026-06-28) — **Superseded by B42h** — delete executed via `presentation/` relocation

**Type:** Research + Planning (implementation slice follows parity proof)

**Risk class:** Critical — deleting `packages/appshell/src/shadcn-studio/` without parity breaks `@afenda/appshell` public API (~60 block exports)

**Clean Core impact:** A→B — strangler cutover; re-seed via MCP only; never migrate legacy TSX

## Purpose

Inventory legacy appshell shadcn/studio block surface, compare against `@afenda/shadcn-studio` seed inventory, define parity gates, and produce a deterministic delete sequence. **No filesystem delete in this slice.**

## Handoff block

```
Handoff from: docs/PAS/slice/b42b-pas005a-legacy-delete-planning.md

1. Objective    — Document block parity inventory, classify legacy appshell studio exports, and define MCP re-seed + delete gates; prove delete is blocked until parity.
2. Allowed layer— docs/PAS/slice/b42b-pas005a-legacy-delete-planning.md · docs/PAS/pas-status-index.md · docs/PAS/PAS-005A-SHADCN-STUDIO-PRESENTATION-STANDARD.md (§14 sequence only)

4. Prohibited   — DELETE packages/appshell/src/shadcn-studio/** · Edit foundation-disposition.registry.ts · Migrate/copy legacy TSX · Edit packages/appshell/src/index.ts re-exports (follow-on slice)
5. Authority    — PAS-005A §11.1 · §11.4 · ADR-0017 · PKGR05A prohibited `do-not-migrate-appshell-studio-tsx`

## Parity snapshot (2026-06-28)

| Surface | Legacy (deleted `packages/appshell/src/shadcn-studio` — B42h) | Target (`packages/shadcn-studio`) | Parity |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Production block TSX (excl. stories) | **63** | **2** (placeholder-hero, placeholder-form) | **3%** |
| UI primitives (`src/components/ui/`) | 0 (uses `@afenda/ui` in blocks) | **5** (button, card, input, label, select) | B40 minimum met |
| Theme presets | N/A (css-authority + appshell CSS) | **12 + default** | Target owns presets |
| Data fixtures | 6 files under `data/` | 0 | Not ported — re-seed or drop with block |
| Assets | 1 illustration | 0 | Follow block re-seed |
| Storybook stories (legacy tree) | ~25 `.stories.tsx` in appshell | 3 lab stories in `apps/storybook/stories/shadcn-studio-*.stories.tsx` | Lab only on target |

**Verdict:** **DELETE BLOCKED at planning time (2026-06-28).** Superseded — delete executed in B42h via `presentation/` relocation. Historical parity snapshot below retained as evidence.

## Delete sequence (follow-on slice — **not B42b**)

Execute only when **all** preconditions pass:

1. **MCP re-seed** — From `packages/shadcn-studio` with credentials in `.env.secret`:
   - `/cui` collect-all-then-install for each production block category above
   - `/rui` for any missing primitives referenced by promoted blocks
   - Replace B40 placeholders; document provenance headers per B40 slice
2. **Storybook parity** — Lab stories cover each promoted block category OR ERP spot-check sign-off documented
3. **Appshell re-export bridge** — Update `packages/appshell/src/index.ts` to re-export from `@afenda/shadcn-studio` (or thin wrappers) **before** delete
4. **Consumer scan** — `rg '@afenda/appshell.*[Ss]tudio|shadcn-studio'` across monorepo; zero direct legacy path imports
5. **Gates** — `pnpm ui:guard`, `pnpm --filter @afenda/appshell test:run`, `pnpm --filter @afenda/erp typecheck`, `pnpm quality:boundaries`
6. **Delete** — `git rm -r packages/appshell/src/shadcn-studio/` + remove `afenda-appshell-studio.css` bridge if superseded
7. **Registry** — `foundation-registry-owner` may promote `PKGR05A` to `green-lane` when B42b implementation slice closes

## MCP re-seed operator checklist

```bash
# cwd MUST be packages/shadcn-studio (shadcn-studio.config.json)
cd packages/shadcn-studio
# Credentials: repo root .env.secret (shadcn-studio MCP)
# Workflow: /cui and /rui — collect ALL blocks before ANY install (ADR-0017)
```

Agent environment note: MCP shadcn-studio server was unavailable during B40; manual seed satisfied minimum DoD. Live re-seed is **operator-owned** until MCP session is available.

## Rules frozen

1. **Parity before delete** — This slice proves parity is **not** met (3% blocks)
2. **Re-seed, never migrate** — No copy from `packages/appshell/src/shadcn-studio/`
3. **Registry** — Lane promotion after delete is registry-owner only
4. **ERP auth ui:guard** — Separate slice (3 files fixed 2026-06-28)

## DoD (B42b planning)

- [x] Parity inventory table with counts
- [x] Legacy block manifest by category
- [x] Delete preconditions documented
- [x] MCP operator checklist
- [x] Explicit **delete blocked** attestation
- [x] Filesystem delete (executed B42h — `presentation/` relocation)
- [ ] MCP live re-seed (deferred — operator)
